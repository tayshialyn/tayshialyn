# Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋
Hi, I'm @tayshialyn, a professional with a background in food science & nutrition and clinical trials. After spending 8 years in the industry, I'm transitioning my career towards one which has more focus on technology, driven by my passion for innovation and problem-solving.

## About Me
👀 I'm interested in the transformative power of technology, particularly in enhancing research, data analysis, and process optimization. Witnessing analysts utilizing Python for data analysis ignited my interest in the tech industry.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a journey to pick up more software skills. I'm fascinated by the versatility of software engineering and the opportunity to build user-friendly applications while solving complex problems logically.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve building impactful solutions for end-users, perhaps in the research or health industry, where I can leverage my previous domain knowledge and software engineering experience.

⚡ Fun Fact: I enjoy exploring new cuisines and experimenting with recipes in my free time!

## Future Goals
In the next 2-3 years, I aim to develop small apps and contribute to larger systems and/or workflows, building a solid tech knowledge and portfolio.

## Transferable Skills
My prior experience has equipped me with valuable transferable skills such as data analysis, attention to detail, project management, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks. These skills will be instrumental in maintaining code quality, adhering to industry standards, and developing robust applications.

## Reasons for Transition
I decided to shift my career due to organizational changes in my previous job, which led to misalignment with my long-term goals. Transitioning towards the tech industry allows me to pursue my passion for innovation and continuous learning, aligning with my career aspirations for personal and professional growth.

Feel free to connect and collaborate with me on exciting projects! 🚀
